;;TODO: should all reading is the ByteArrayOutputStream approach in remote_repl read-command-output?
(defn eval!
"
eval some code in the remote repl session on the given socket.

push necessary deps and start repl on remote machine.
start a server with: (def server (create-repl-server 8080))
get a client socket with: (def client (new Socket \"localhost\" 8080))
eval on client: (eval! client '(+ 1 2))

a perhaps better implimentation would be:

 (defn eval! [socket expr]
  (let [rdr (LineNumberingPushbackReader. 
	     (reader (.getInputStream socket)))
	wtr (writer (.getOutputStream socket))]
    (binding [*out* wtr]
      (prn expr)
      (flush)
      (read rdr) ;;reads and discards the clojure.core=>
      (read rdr))))

...but the read function blows up when the stream contains java objects that have been printed #< > or exceptions.
